        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2020, The Coffee Corner was born from a passion for community and a perfect brew. We are a family-run café dedicated to bringing you the finest ethically sourced beans from local roasters, paired with delicious homemade pastries baked fresh daily.</p>
        <p>Our space is designed to be your home away from home – whether you're catching up with friends, getting some work done, or simply enjoying a moment of peace with a great book and a flat white.</p>
        <p>We believe in sustainability, quality, and most importantly, our wonderful customers.</p>
